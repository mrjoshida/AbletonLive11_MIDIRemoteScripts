# Customized KeyLab MKII Ableton Live 11 Remote Scripts

I love the KeyLab MKII, but the default mapping for Live doesn't quite suit my user flow. This is an experimental custom script to see if I can get the workflow closer to my ideal.

I'm basing this work on the decompiled scripts posted by Julien Bayle. You can find more information from that project on this page :
